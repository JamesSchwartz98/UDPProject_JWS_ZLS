# UDPProject_JWS_ZLS

 CS-415 Data Comm & Network Project #1
 
 The aim of the project was to create two java applications, a client and a server, where the client would accept two arguments, an IP address and a port number, and to send a request for quotes to the server application. The server application checking for user input/requests and when given a request from the client, would pull a random quote from the quote.csv file. Then the client would output the quote and the server would output date, time, and the IP of the request.
 
 James put framework together for Server and Client files, researched using date and time functionality. Did testing with various functionality versions of the code either implementing into the code itself or as a seperate bare-bones functionality. Wrote up the README.md file
 Zack looked up the other quotes for the CSV file, assisted with research for time and date functionality
 Both were giving input on programming while on a discord call, screen sharing and looking over various documentation when writing the programs.

Running Program:
1. Compile both programs in two different terminals.
2. Run the Server program by inputting "java Server".
3. Run the Client program along with inputting "IP address" "2025".
4. In Client terminal, type REQUESTQUOTE to receive a quote.
5. To terminate the session of the client type END.
6. To terminate the server session, hit CTRL+C in the respective terminal.
